# ansible-playbooks
Ansible playbooks to setup initial configurations, install various utilities, and security tools to localhost.

## Playbooks
I needed something to install tools quickly after a new fresh OS install.

This branch is tailored for the disco releases of Ubuntu.

## Testing
This has been tested on disco 19.04.

### Dependencies
Packages to be installed prior to running the playbooks.

```bash
$ apt update
$ apt -y install python-apt ansible
```
Optionally, many of these tools can be installed by the `forensics-all` package described in [Debian Forensics Environment - essential components](https://packages.debian.org/sid/forensics-all).

### Examples
Perform a dry run:

```bash
$ sudo ansible-playbook play_apt.yml --check
```

List tasks or tags:
```bash
$ sudo ansible-playbook play_apt.yml --list-tasks
```

Install or skip specific tasks:
```bash
$ sudo ansible-playbook play_apt.yml --tags "deb-utils,pip3-sec"
$ sudo ansible-playbook play_apt.yml --skip-tags "deb-sec,pip-sec"
```

Run playbook and all install tools to localhost:

```bash
$ sudo ansible-playbook play_apt.yml
```
Run the playbook with specific host and install malware-analysis tools
(Before launch the play-book please update the host.yml file and also add ssh prive key file into the ssh-creds folder  )
```bash
$ sudo ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False ansible-playbook -i host.yml malware-analysis.yml  
```
